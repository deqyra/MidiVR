# MidiVR
### A generic MIDI controller: does the same as MIDI keyboards, but without keyboards and in VR.


**Written in C#, using Unity3D and SteamVR for HTC Vive.**  
This is a MIDI controller: it does not play sound _per se_, it sends note data to a host program which then plays them using a software synth, and outputs the sound.
